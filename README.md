Breif Introduction: The challenges of our time regarding global climate change
and the recent energy crises are challenges that humanity must face in order
to master them.
The global supply of people with food and raw materials has also played an
increasingly important role in the lives of most people, especially since the
year 2022.
The steadily increasing world population has consumed more raw materials
since the end of the Second World War than in the entire history of mankind
before.
The annual global demand for wood has increased by more than 800 percent
during this period. At the same time, natural forest resources are dwindling
annually in a dimension that corresponds to an area larger than that of
Germany. As a result of these developments, the competitive pressure among
wood buyers is greater today than ever before.
Processing industries in the fields of house building, furniture and paper
production and bioenergy are competing with each other for the coveted and
increasingly scarce raw material wood. and raw material prices for decades.
